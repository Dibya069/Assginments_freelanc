As summer winds down, publicly traded companies are sharing their second-quarter results. This year, the focus was on the rise of diabetes and weight loss drugs like Ozempic. Ozempic, a type of GLP-1 drug, has revolutionized the weight loss industry. It works by mimicking a glucagon-like peptide that regulates appetite in the brain, leaving users feeling sated for hours.

Medifast, a company that makes diet products like shakes and protein bars, reported a 34.7% decline in earnings due to the rise of Ozempic. However, Medifast's CEO, Dan R. Chard, believes Ozempic presents an opportunity for the company to offer solutions for those on the drugs.

Other companies, like Herbalife, are also looking for ways to capitalize on the trend. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, has seen its earnings soar 32% in the first half of the year. The company's CEO believes the drug has vast potential, not only for solving obesity but also for treating addiction and Alzheimer's.

The ripple effects of Ozempic are spreading. Retailers like Walmart and Kroger are seeing increased foot traffic and sales due to the increased use of GLP-1 drugs. Medtronic, a company that specializes in bariatric surgery, has seen a dip in demand for its services.

Some analysts believe the drugs could disrupt the American diet. ""If you're eating fast food every day, you'll probably continue to eat fast food every day,"" said James van Geelen of Citrinas Capital Management. ""You'll just eat a lot less of it.""

The U.S. labor market is also showing signs of improvement. Employers added 187,000 jobs in August, and unemployment rose to 3.8%. The economy is facing headwinds, but there are signs of growth.

In other news, the White House has announced its first list of Medicare price negotiations. The list includes 10 medicines, which will be subject to negotiations to reduce costs. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, and some Republicans have criticized it as government overreach.

The article about the #Girlboss movement was an interesting contrast to the rest of the article. The term ""girlboss"" was coined by Sophia Amoruso in her 2014 memoir. Glossier, a skin care and beauty brand, changed the way women buy makeup with its direct-to-consumer model and voice-y website. However, the brand struggled and eventually shelved projects, including a makeup line that departed from its original style.

The article's author, Marisa Meltzer, believes the #Girlboss movement was offensive and diminutive. Some companies, like Outdoor Voices and Man Repeller, faced scandals and lawsuits. What do you think about these companies having men at the helm? Would the press have covered the scandals differently? The reality is that these companies weren't the same, and the women at their helm weren't the same.","""Industry Move""",Neutral

Eli Lilly's new drug, Zepbound, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic weight management in obese or overweight adults with at least one weight-related health complication. The drug contains the active ingredient tirzepatide, already approved for treating type 2 diabetes.

According to the FDA, approximately 70% of Americans are overweight or obese, and a recent report projects that more than half of the world's population could be overweight or obese by 2035. The agency reports that losing 5-10% of overall body weight can lower the risk of developing heart disease.

Zepbound has been shown to be an effective weight management drug in combination with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. It works by activating receptors for two hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), to suppress appetite.

Common side effects of the weekly injectable include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. In animal studies, the drug caused thyroid C-cell tumors, though it's unknown if it can cause the same cancer in humans.

Zepbound is expected to be available by the end of the year for a list price of $1,059, which is 20% less than rival semaglutide, marketed as Novo Nordisk's Ozempic or Wegovy.

The demand for weight loss medications has led to a market of counterfeit drugs, which have caused hospitalizations. However, the availability of Zepbound has also raised concerns over insurance coverage, with many considering obesity a ""carve-out"" condition.

Despite the challenges, experts remain hopeful that continued advocacy, scientific advancements, and data will improve access to this life-changing medication.

Bristol Myers Squibb, a New York-based company, plans to double its number of treatments in clinical trials over the next 18 months. The move aims to offset declining demand for two of its top-selling drugs, Revlimid and Eliquis, which face generic competition.

The company currently has six treatments in trials and plans to advance six more, including three cell therapies targeting immune system disorders and different types of cancer. Bristol has received regulatory approval for a cell therapy manufacturing facility in Massachusetts and will continue expanding its manufacturing capacity.

"Here is the rewritten article:

Austin Wolcott was just 18 when he was told his Stage 4 Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma had returned despite aggressive chemotherapy. But his doctors at the Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, had an unusual idea: try CAR-T therapy, a relatively new and experimental treatment.

""Everything about CAR-T sounded like something out of a science-fiction movie,"" Wolcott recalls. ""It was portrayed as a cancer-seeking missile that knew exactly where to go and what to do.""

CAR-T therapy boils down to creating cells that outsmart cancer, beating it at its own game. The science is simple: cancers aren't supposed to develop in humans, but they can be sneaky. With CAR-T, a patient's own T-cells – which fight viruses – are removed from the body and genetically edited to identify and kill cancer cells.

Wolcott took a chance and received his first CAR-T infusion on November 6, 2020. Within days, his cancer began retreating. A month later, it was gone. As of his two-year anniversary of remission, Wolcott is grateful to be cancer-free.

CAR-T therapy has come a long way since the 1990s, when immunologists like Dr. Michel Sadelain first convinced peers that genetically engineered T-cells were worth exploring. In 2003, Sadelain's team demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in mice, sparking excitement.

More recent breakthroughs include treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, and myeloma. According to Dr. John F. DiPersio, chief of the division of oncology at Washington University in St. Louis, ""more than a decade later, two out of three patients treated with CAR-T therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia are still in remission.""

Dr. Brian Brown, Director of the Icahn Genomics Institute at Mount Sinai in New York City, notes that tumors evolve ways to suppress the immune system, putting a brake on T-cells. The pesky molecules released by CAR-T cells can lead to high fevers and organ failure. Researchers are working on a new method to prevent cytokine release.

One major hurdle for CAR-T therapy is cost, ranging from $375,000 to $475,000 per person. Insurance providers pay some of the bill, but patients often walk away with $1 million in debt.

The most obvious way to reduce costs is by reducing FDA regulatory mandates or developing off-the-shelf therapies, which use engineered cells from a third party rather than a patient's own T-cells. Big pharma companies are already conducting trials on off-the-shelf technology.

Cautiously optimistic about the future, Dr. Chu says, ""This is the tip of the iceberg... there are CAR T-cells that have shown significant activity against glioblastoma multiforme, and some forms of muscle and bone cancers.""

As we live in a world where cancer treatment is slowly evolving, the statistics speak for themselves. With CAR-T therapy, patients are experiencing remissions of more than a year, and tumour masses are completely gone. For Austin Wolcott, being cancer-free after 1,000 days and celebrating with a trip to the Blue Ridge Rock Festival is a testament to the advancements made.

Cancer: The Formidable Adversary

Cancer, the emperor of all maladies, presents a complex challenge to global health. It's a battle that requires innovative solutions and accessible treatments. CytoMed Therapeutics is a name that has emerged as a leader in the field, with a novel approach combining advanced cellular science and biotechnology.

The goal of CytoMed is to provide effective and affordable cancer treatments, addressing the significant barrier of prohibitive costs. Their mission is to break barriers, change narratives, and bring hope to millions affected by cancer worldwide.

Cancer is a complex and multifaceted disease, with unique genetic mutations, cellular interactions, and responses to external factors. The diverse range of cancer subtypes requires the development of various therapies, which can drive up costs and limit access.

Financial toxicity is a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often making therapies unattainable for many patients. Dr. Wee Kiat Tan, Chief Operating Officer of CytoMed, highlights the importance of affordable solutions: ""You could have the best solution, but if it's not affordable, how are you going to make a difference?""

Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment modality, leveraging the body's immune system to fight cancer. CAR-T therapy has shown promising results, with some patients achieving complete remission.

However, traditional CAR-T therapy has significant challenges, including high costs associated with customization, scalability issues, and time-consuming processes. CytoMed is developing a game-changing alternative, using Gamma Delta T cells, a subset of T cells derived from healthy donors.

Gamma Delta T cells can recognize a wide array of cancers without the need for complex genetic modification, making them a universal solution. CytoMed's approach eliminates patient-specific customization, reducing costs and logistical complexity.

By producing the therapy on a large scale, CytoMed can significantly reduce costs, potentially transforming CAR-T therapy from high-cost to affordable. This could revolutionize cancer treatment and make high-quality therapy accessible to a broader patient population.

CytoMed's relentless pursuit of innovation continues to break new ground in CAR-T therapy, with ongoing research and potential advancements. The vision of a future where high-quality cancer therapy is accessible to all is growing closer, with CytoMed's ongoing efforts.",Innovation,Positive
"**FDA Investigates Cancer Therapies Over Risk of Serious Side Effects**

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched an investigation into cancer therapies developed by companies such as Gilead Sciences and Johnson & Johnson due to concerns about a serious safety issue.

The FDA has received reports of patients developing T-cell malignancies, including lymphomas and leukemias, after receiving CAR-T therapies. These therapies are designed to treat cancer by editing and re-infusing disease-fighting T-cells.

Companies affected by the investigation include Gilead's Kite unit, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Janssen, and Legend Biotech. Some of these companies have seen a decline in their stock prices, with Autolus Therapeutics experiencing a 12% drop in afternoon trading.

Gilead has cooperated with the FDA's request for an analysis of its data, and the company claims that there is no evidence linking its therapies to the development of new malignancies. The FDA advises that patients receiving these treatments should be monitored lifelong for new malignancies.

CAR-T therapies involve extracting and re-engineering T-cells to attack cancer, and while they have shown promise in treating certain types of cancer, these serious side effects have raised concerns.",Innovation,Negative

"A federal judge in New York has dismissed a lawsuit accusing McDonald's and Wendy's of misleading consumers with ads that exaggerate the size and quality of their burgers. The lawsuit, filed by Justin Chimienti, claimed that the companies' ads deceive customers by showing bigger, juicier burgers than they actually serve.

However, Judge Hector Gonzalez ruled that the ads on the companies' websites provide vital information about the burgers, including the weight of the meat and calories. He also found that Chimienti failed to prove that a reasonable customer would be misled by the ads. Gonzalez characterized the ads as ""puffery,"" akin to models used by other companies to make products more visually appealing.

Unilever and the I'm Not Done Yet Foundation have settled their trademark dispute over the use of the phrase ""Not Done Yet"" to market Degree deodorant and other products. The charity, founded by Peter Menges in memory of his son Bobby, who died of cancer at 19, had sued Unilever in July. 

The foundation alleged that Unilever's use of the phrase threatened to cause consumer confusion and hurt its fundraising efforts. The charity also claimed that Unilever's use of the phrase in connection with social impact programs increased the risk of confusion.

The case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, was dropped after the parties reached an agreement.",Trademark Dispute,Neutral
"Nestle, the world's largest packaged food maker, has chosen WPP Openmind as its sole media agency in Europe. This decision comes amid a cost of living crisis that is changing consumer shopping habits and will allow Nestle to target consumers more efficiently.

This win for WPP Openmind, a subsidiary of the world's top advertising group WPP, marks a major milestone despite a decline in global ad spending. In August, WPP downgraded its full-year growth forecast due to the decreased spending by technology companies.

Nestle believes that this partnership will enable better decision-making and more effective media planning, allowing their campaigns to build brands and capture consumer attention at scale. WPP Openmind will be responsible for coordinating Nestle's marketing communications, including planning, buying, and activating campaigns for over 2,000 of its brands, including Kit Kat and Nescafe.

Nestle declined to comment on its advertising spend in Europe, but the partnership is expected to strengthen the company's marketing efforts in the region.",Marketing Efforts,Positive
"Get Smart About News: A Free Newsletter for the Public 

The National Science Foundation's NewsLit project, modeled on the Sift, offers a free weekly newsletter for the public. NewsLit's e-learning platform, Checkology, empowers educators to teach middle and high school students how to identify credible information, rely on reliable sources, and debunk myths. It also emphasizes the importance of the First Amendment and a free press.

1. A surprising investigation by The Examination and The Washington Post revealed that dietitians are being paid to promote sugary drinks and unhealthy snacks on TikTok and Instagram. The Canadian Sugar Institute and American Beverage Association, representing PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, are backing these influencer dietitians. Posts often feature unproven claims and questionable messages about nutrition and healthy eating. Many dietitians failed to disclose their connections with the food and beverage industry.

2. China launched a massive disinformation campaign about the wildfires in Hawaii, spreading AI-generated content and disinformation online. This tactic marks a shift for Chinese disinformation campaigns, which typically support Chinese policies rather than stirring division in the US. Researchers from Microsoft, NewsGuard, and the RAND Corporation identified China's social media network and believe it may be used in future influence operations, such as the 2024 US presidential election.

NewsLit takeaway: False claims often build upon previous narratives. A video of smoke from a helicopter may seem innocuous, but those familiar with false population control and Gates conspiracy theories might believe it shows mosquitoes being released. News literacy skills, like reverse image searches and critical thinking, can prevent people from falling into these rabbit holes.

NewsLit takeaway: Misrepresented and genuine footage is easily debunked with a reverse image search. In this case, the Associated Press traced the footage back to an art gallery, which confirmed it was an artwork. Believers in such false claims often worry about slippery slopes, assuming that if one odd event occurs, more extreme events will follow. This reasoning is a fallacious argument frequently exploited by misinformation.",Aspect: Information Literacy,Negative
